# Imagenator

## OCI container scanner

### Our main goals are:
 - Finding vulnerability artefacts by generating SBOMs(software bill of materials) and searching vulnerabilities in them
 - Ability to control dependencies
 - Seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines
 - Notifications via vk teams or telegram bots

### Future plans:
 - Caching results
 - Additional bot integrations
 - Visualisation of dependencies
 - Support for additional types, not only containers
